/**
 * oath_hotp_generate:
 * @secret: the shared secret string
 * @secret_length: length of @secret
 * @moving_factor: a counter indicating the current OTP to generate
 * @digits: number of requested digits in the OTP, excluding checksum
 * @add_checksum: whether to add a checksum digit or not
 * @truncation_offset: use a specific truncation offset
 * @output_otp: output buffer, must have room for the output OTP plus zero
 *
 * Generate a one-time-password using the HOTP algorithm as described
 * in RFC 4226.
 *
 * Use a value of %OATH_HOTP_DYNAMIC_TRUNCATION for @truncation_offset
 * unless you really need a specific truncation offset.
 *
 * To find out the size of the OTP you may use the OATH_HOTP_LENGTH()
 * macro.  The @output_otp buffer must be have room for that length
 * plus one for the terminating NUL.
 *
 * Currently only values 6, 7 and 8 for @digits are supported, and the
 * @add_checksum value is ignored.  These restrictions may be lifted
 * in future versions, although some limitations are inherent in the
 * protocol.
 *
 * Returns: On success, %OATH_OK (zero) is returned, otherwise an
 *   error code is returned.
